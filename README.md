# Adware

This Python program, built using the PyQt5 library, is designed to run as an adware application that shows intrusive promotional windows on the user's screen. The core functionality revolves around downloading external resources, including a Python script and configuration file, from a remote server. The program downloads these files asynchronously using multithreading, ensuring that the user interface remains responsive and the background tasks do not interfere with the program's functionality. This allows the program to perform other operations, such as downloading ad images, without interruption.

Once the program has successfully downloaded the necessary files, it then fetches a set of promotional ad images from pre-defined URLs. These images are stored locally and randomly selected each time an ad window is displayed. The program uses the PyQt5 framework to create simple dialog windows that display both the promotional image and a text message. The text is styled to be visually prominent, and the images are resized to fit the window layout.

Each ad window is displayed at a random position on the screen, with the coordinates being dynamically calculated based on the screen's resolution. This randomness in positioning enhances the intrusive nature of the ads, as the windows appear unpredictably across the screen. The ads remain visible for a brief moment before disappearing, and new windows are created to show further advertisements, repeating this cycle.

In addition to showing the adware windows, the program runs a downloaded Python script in the background. This script is executed using the `subprocess` module, and it operates silently without interacting with the user interface. The main program continues displaying ads while the script runs, allowing both tasks to occur simultaneously without disrupting each other. The use of the `threading` module ensures that these actions run in parallel, so the user is not forced to wait for one task to complete before another begins.

The program is designed to operate continuously, launching new ad windows and running background scripts as long as it's active. The multithreaded design allows for a seamless user experience, as it ensures that the program does not freeze or become unresponsive during its operations. This makes it ideal for scenarios where continuous operation is desired without interfering with the user’s normal activities on their computer.

Although this program demonstrates the basic functionality of adware by displaying ads and running background scripts, it highlights how PyQt5 and Python’s multithreading capabilities can be used to create an interactive yet non-intrusive experience for the user. However, given that adware is often associated with unethical practices, it’s important to understand that this code is for educational purposes and should not be used to create malicious software.
